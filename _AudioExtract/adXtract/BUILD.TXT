--------------------------

extract ADX files from any archive, by recognizing signatures
usage: c:\docume~1\jason\desktop\adXtract2\adXtract2.exe archive.zzz [ ... archive.zzz ]

Windows (Cygwin/MinGW):
  Just run make.

Windows (VS6):
  VS6 workspace and project files included; open and compile in VS. Note that MSVC is
  #defined in the project options, and isn't something VS does by default.

Linux:
  Just run make (this will produce a file called adXtract2.exe but it is a native exe).

OSX:
  Probably just run make, I didn't try it.

The EXE file here was built with gcc 3.4.5 and is for Windows.
